/**
* The Loading State is going to be used to load in all of the in-game assets that we need in game.
*
* Because in this blueprint there is only a single "hidden object" section we are going to load in all of 
* the asset's at this point.
*
* If you have multiple states however, I would recommend have loading the other graphics as they are required by their states, 
* Otherwise the loading times maybe a bit long and it is not the most optimal solution.

/**
* Since we want to use the custom Kiwi.JS loader with the bobing kiwi/html5 logo and everything. We need to extend the KiwiLoadingScreen State.  
* The KiwiLoadingScreen State is an extentsion of a normal State but it has some custom code to handle the loading/bobbing/fading of all the items, so if you override a method (like the preload) for example just make sure you call the super method.
* 
* The parameters we are passing into this method are as ordered.
* 1 - name {String} Name of this state.
* 2 - stateToSwitch {String} Name of the state to switch to AFTER all the assets have loaded. Note: The state you want to switch to should already have been added to the game.
* 3 - dimensions {Object} A Object containing the width/height that the game is to be. For example {width: 1024, height: 768}
* 4 - subfolder {String} The folder that the loading graphics are located at.
